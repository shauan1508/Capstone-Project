**ðŸ§  Capstone Project â€“ Autonomous Gutter Cleaning Robot**

This repository contains all source code and simulations developed for our final-year mechatronics capstone project: an autonomous gutter-cleaning robot designed for residential and industrial applications. Our robot autonomously navigates standard 5-inch A-style gutters, detects turns using color sensors, and performs debris cleaning using a rotary brush and blower system.

**ðŸ”§ Repository Contents:**

Dimension Simulation/
Python-based simulations to model the robot's dimensional movement and validate turning clearances.

Motor Test/
Arduino test code (L293D driver) to individually tune and validate motor behavior before integration.

Robot Code/
Final integrated ESP32 code for autonomous cleaning, navigation, and motor control.

**ðŸ“Œ Highlights:**

ESP32 microcontroller with Wi-Fi and color sensor integration

Custom motor control logic for coordinated maneuvering in tight gutter corners

Modular 3D-printed chassis optimized via FEA

Live-tested with over 89% cleaning efficiency and 63% reduction in manual intervention vs. baseline
